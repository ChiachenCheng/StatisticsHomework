# StatisticsHomework

This repository contains my Statistics course homework. I have learned data analysis skills including ANOVA, regression, simulation, and some methods that reduce multicollinearity such as PCR. My codes are written in Python, store in ipynb documents. If Jupyter Notebook is installed in your computer, please use it to run the whole projects. If not, you can still see my codes in the PDF documents.
